## Overview/ Motivation

Let’s move our API closer to production grade by adding Authentication and switching to a Production Server

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Features - Django

- Add JWT Authentication to your API.
  - Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.

- Keep any pre-existing authentication so DRF Browsable API still usable.
  - Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.

Features - Docker

- Create a boilerplate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so you don’t need to start from scratch each time.

- E.g. as a VS Code snippet, or a gist.

- Switch to using Gunicorn instead of Django’s built in development server.
  - mind the number of workers to avoid sluggishness

- Warning You will run into styling issues when you switch over to Gunicorn.
  - On Django side you’ll need to properly handle static files using Whitenoise

Storage Options

- Your choice of SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Adjust docker-compose.yml so that data is persisted in a volume outside of container.
  - These steps are different depending on whether SQLite or PostgreSQL is being used.

## Tools & Dependencies

- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Black
- Docker
- psycopg2-binary

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone down repo and install dependencies

```iterm
poetry shell
poetry install
```

### 2. Create a New Secret Key by running the following command in the terminal:

```iterm
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; \
            print(get_random_secret_key())'
```

### 3. Add new key to settings.py line 23

```python
SECRET_KEY = "django-insecure-INSERT_NEW_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

### 4. App folder currently named "Concert". Replace this with your app name

- These steps will change the app name and all occurences of "Concert"
- Do a global search of "Concert" and replace all occurences with your new app name
  - (For this step your app name needs to be a capital word) ex Concert -> Blog
  - Make sure to select "Match Case" option. [Aa]
  - (There will only be 36 matches. If you see 42, you didn't check your case)
- The following steps requires a lowercase version of your app name(4 places you have to change)
  - Replace "Concert" folder name
  - In app.py - line 6, make sure name variable is lowercase
  - In project/urls.py, fix urlpatterns on line 19 to use lowercase
  - In project/settings.py check INSTALLED_APPS to make sure your app name is lowercased

### 5a. If you want to run with docker, run the following commands:

```iterm
docker-compose up
docker-compose run web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5b. If you want to run in just the terminal, run the following commands:

```iterm
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Notes

This project makes use of a custom user that over writes django's default user model. When you create new models that need to reference user as a foreign key, you need to make the following changes:

```python
# Old Way

from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(get_user_model(), on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# ----------------------------------- New Way -----------------------------------

from django.conf import settings

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

```

In your tests, you would still use get_user_model()

### Commands To Know

```python
poetry export -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt --without-hashes
docker-compose up
docker-compose -d
docker-compose down
docker-compose logs
docker-compose up --build
```
